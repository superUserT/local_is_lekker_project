# Local is Lekker: simple online market place website using Django

This is an online marketplace application for local businesses.

Live site available at: <http://thabiso.pythonanywhere.com/>

## Environment

This project is interpreted/tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

## Installation

* Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/superUserT/local_is_lekker_project.git
```

* Access Local_is_lekker directory:

```
cd local_is_lekker
```

* Install all dependancies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Local_is_lekker:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## Development Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment for development. To do this:

bash

```
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment:

bash

```
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:

bash

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

After activating your virtual environement set up a development environment. Ideally you'll be installing this in a virtualenv.

```
python setup.py develop
```

What this does is legit install your package. So now you can import your package from anywhere so long as your venv is active.

Dectivate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash

```
venv\Scripts\deactivate
```

On Unix or MacOS:

bash

```
deactivate
```

Running the deactivate command will deactivate the currently active virtual environment, and you'll return to the global Python environment.
